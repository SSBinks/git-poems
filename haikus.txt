Early morning yellow flowers,
thinking abuot
the drunkards of Mexico.

No telegram today
only more leavs
fell.

Nightfall,
boy smashing danddelions
with a stick.

Holding up my
purring cat to teh moon
I sighed.

Drunk as a hoot owl,
writing letters
by thundrestrom.

Empty baseball field
a robin
hops alongg the bench.

Elephants munching
on grass - loviing
Head side by side.

Missing a kick
at teh icebox door
It closed anyway.

This July evening,
a large frog
On my door sill.

Catfish fighting for his life,
and #winning,
Splashing us all.
